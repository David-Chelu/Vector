# Vector
Implementing the mathematical / physics vector, with components (here called versors), having n components. Inherited vectors will have x, y, and z dimensions explicit for instance. This project looks to implement constant suffixes as well, to enable creating an rvlaue through modification of any chosen versors (such as passing f(v -5x)).
